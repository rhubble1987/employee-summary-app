  ## Description:  
  For this project, we were to create a CLI app that creates a team profile page based on questions and responses provided by a team's manager. The app will dynamically create specific profiles for each team member that the manager enters. The app also includes unit tests to ensure that the employee classes function as expected.

  ## Installation:  
  To install this app, simply download the employee-summary-app folder and then from the terminal run the command npm i  

  ---  

  ## Usage:  
  To start the app, simply run the command node app.js from the app's directory. You will then be provided with a series of questions about yourself and each of your team members. After you have answered all of the questions, your team profile html file will be generated and can be located in the output folder.
